### FAQ

- **Why does the specified codec or resolution not apply?**  
  For 4K or 8K videos, use VP9 or AV1 codecs. YouTube does not support H265, so H264 is used as a fallback. If no matching format is found, the closest available combination will be selected.

- **Can I download entire playlists?**  
  Yes, it is supported (confirmed for YouTube).

- **Can I download age-restricted or membership-only videos?**  
  Yes, by specifying cookies. Always verify compliance with membership terms.

- **Is it legal to download copyrighted content?**  
  No. Do not download illegally uploaded videos. The author holds no responsibility for misuse.
